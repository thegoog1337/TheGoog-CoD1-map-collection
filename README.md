## About the Project

This project contains a collection of custom multiplayer maps designed for the original *Call of Duty 1* game. The maps have been created using the **Radiant Level Editor**, which is widely used for building maps for Quake-engine games.

These maps are designed to have a lot of fun with vanilla CoD1.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the custom maps:

1. **Download the map files** from this repository.
2. Open the downloaded `.map` files with CoDRadiant.
3. When opened you may find missing textures here and there. Im not gonna provide those. You have to replace them.
