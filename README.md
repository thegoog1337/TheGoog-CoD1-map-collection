## About the Project

This project contains a collection of custom multiplayer designed for the original *Call of Duty 1* game. The maps have been created using the **Radiant Level Editor**, which is widely used for building maps for Quake-engine games.

These maps are designed to have a lot of fun with vanilla CoD1.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the custom maps:

1. **Download the map files** from this repository.
2. Move the downloaded `.map` files to the following directory:
    - For single-player maps: 
      ```
      C:\Program Files\Call of Duty\Main\maps
      ```
    - For multiplayer maps:
      ```
      C:\Program Files\Call of Duty\Main\mp
      ```
3. Launch *Call of Duty 1* and select the map from the multiplayer or single-player map selection screen.
